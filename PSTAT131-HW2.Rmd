```{r}
abalone <- read.csv("abalone.csv")
```

## 1

```{r}
abalone["age"] <- abalone$rings + 1.5

# Assess and describe the distribution of age.
```

## 2

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

abalone_split <- initial_split(abalone, prop = 0.80, strata = age)
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abalone_test  <- testing (abalone_split)
```

## 3

```{r}

```
We should not use rings to predict age because the two variables would be very highly correlated. This is because age is equal to rings + 1.5.
